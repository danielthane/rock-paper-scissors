# Rock, Paper Scissors

## A Console Based Take on the Classic
This is my solution to the Odin Project task to create an in console rock paper scissors game.

### What I've Learned
- The fundamentals of functions in JS, primarily the idea of return values.
- How to test my code using log statements.
- How to psuedocode and break problems down into manageable chunks.

### How to Improve
- Obviously the fact the game is console based ins't ideal and I would look to addd a UI to this at some point in the future.
